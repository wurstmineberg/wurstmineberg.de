      <h1 class="page-header">So… About this server</h1>
      <p class="lead">TL;DR: Whitelisted vanilla Minecraft server, small number of people, lots of fiddleing in the background.</p>
      
      <h2 id="server">Server</h2>
      <p class="text-info">The Minecraft server is accessible via <code>wurstmannberg.de</code> or <code>mc.wurstmannberg.de</code> – We haven't figured out domain stuff yet.</p>
      <p>Our Minecraft server is currently running on a basic vServer. Nothing fancy, 1-2GB RAM, a single CPU core, 50Gigs of space.
        As more people join the server, we probably need to upgrade sooner or later, but oh well. Turns out decent vServers suitable for
        more than just fancy webhosting aren't as easy to find. Admittedly we haven't looked too hard as of now.</p>
        <p>Before that we were using <a href="https://cubedhost.org/minecraft#overview">CubedHost</a> as our server host, and… Well,
          Everything worked fine (except for one 24h downtime we never found out the reason for), but since we only had access via FTP and
        <a href="http://www.multicraft.org/">Multicraft</a>, we soon ran out of stuff to tinker with. And besided, easy and fast snapshot updates,
         automated backups to different machines and all that aren't really fun to do without shell/ssh access.</p>
        <p>Even before we tried CubedHost, the server was set up on a spare Laptop in Jemus42's apartment. Back then only Jemus42 and BenemitC where playing (needing a way to continue their multiplayer map they started with… less physical distance), so that actually worked. Kind of.So yeah, I guess you could say we've come a long way since then.</p>

      <h2 id="map_version">Map and Versions</h2>
      <p>Our current map was first generated sometime in january '13, therefore the core of the map is Minecraft v1.3 terrain generation. We soon started using the early v1.4 <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/development_versions">snapshots</a> and have been using the latest snapshot (if one is available) ever since. So expect occasional downtimes due to server upgrades and sometimes impending debugging session if the snapshot was a little funky. Another side effect of the snapshot use can be chunks that are generated with experimental settings, so when we upgrade to the v1.7 snapshots (bringing new terrain generation) it might be we get the occasional chunk with features that don't end up in the final release of v1.7. If that's a good thing or a bad thing, we'll find out.</p>
      <p>Another thing concerning terrain generation and version differences: If you're looking for <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Quartz">Nether Quartz</a>, you may need to travel a little. But don't worry too much, we have a nether hub set up which allows you to safely (kind of) continue some tunnels inside the nether roof to get to newly generated nether terrain. As far as <a href="http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Horse">horses</a> are concerned, you may be interested in L3viathan and Jemus42's <em>fahrvergnuegen</em> ranch in the <a href="http://overview.wurstmannberg.de/#/272/64/2217/-4/0/0">south of the map</a>, where the first horses on the server were found and are now kept for breeding, testing, experimentation and other words that sound morally ambiguous. But more about actual Minecraft things later.</p>

      <h2 id="starter">Getting started<h2>
        <p>If you're new and don't know where to go and what to do, chances are you didn't get a server tour by one of our more senior members.
          Sorry about that. The first thing you'll see is our spawn area, which is rather obviously still being built, like so many things on the server.
          "Beneath" the span area is our Nether Hub, which serves as a central community trafficing area and connects various tunnels to other peoples's nether portals. Both the nether hub and spawn area are community oriented builds. All the supplies there are either donated or 
          specifically collected for specific builds or purposes, so … Well, the general rule is "Don't be a dick". If something has a sign with "free to take" on it, you can probably take it. Taking <em>everything</em> is generally frowned upon for reasons of obviousness.
          Also, even if there are usually some community supplies floating around (like steak), please don't rely on them as your only means of, you know, not starving to death.</p>
          <p> If you'd like to work on community builds like spawners, farms or whatever, please try to ask around some of the other people who may or may not have already started preparations for such builds. It's not about <em>owning</em> a community project, it's just about coordination and not stepping on people's toes. However, experience shows that you probably won't be murdered in your sleep if you build at spawn without discussing every minor detail with everyone. Hanging around on the <a href="irc://chat.freenode.net/#wurstmineberg">IRC channel</a> and/or checking out the <a href="http://twitter.com/wurstmineberg">Twitter account</a> and/or checking out the <a href="http://reddit.com/r/wurstmineberg">subreddit front page</a> should give a start as to what's currently going on. And sometimes it doesn't.</p>
          <p>As I was saying, it's about community. As long as you're being reasonable and remember you're not alone on this server (both for your and everybody elses' benefit), everything's fine.</p>
